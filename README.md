## What is GitHub ?
GitHub is a platform that enables you to put a code in some kind of storage called **repository** it's like a folder that holds the text file which containing your code. GitHub build on a protocal called **Git** and it track the history of your modifcation on your code and keep in archive so you can can undo any modification that you do not want.

## What is GitHub Pages ?
It is one of the most intersting features of the _GitHub platform_ that does allow you to luanch your website with a live url so you can check your work and you can share this url with others.
 
## What is Markdown ?
GitHub introduced a markup language similar to Html called **Markdown**. I should say this language is so easy to learn and it has a nice documetation you can check it on this link [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).It is basically takes some special charater, like # or * and apply them to the text in different ways by this it can change the way how the text will present on the web. 
For Example if we need to include a block of code in your web page we can wrap the code in backticks like this:
`var example = true`
but if we have a multiple lines, this is how you do it:

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
Maybe you want to iclude an image in your web page, this is how you do it:
