## What I learned from Lab: 03 - Revisions and the Cloud ?
 
I learned how to use Git to clone a project from cloud to my computer by typing the following Git command in the terminal 
`git clone` and past the repo url .

Also I can make changes on the project locally and push those changes through three Git commands to the cloud
1. `git add` and the name of the file was changed.
2. `git commit -m ""` with this command I should type a meaningfully message between the quotation marks about the changes that I made.
3. `git push` with this command I push the changes to the cloud.
