## About me
I am Abdallah, a computer engineer, from Gaza. As of now, I work as a web developer but I once worked as math teacher and also as a journalist for a media agency.
I know that's a bit weird, but I don't mind weirdness because I enjoy discovering new things all the time. It's a hobby to me. On another note, I really love to read.  I also like to write sometimes because I know that words are powerful in a magical way. My dream is not big and it's not small, either. I dream of making good impact on myself and every one I encounter. Well, if you read this far, then you know almost the most important things about me.
